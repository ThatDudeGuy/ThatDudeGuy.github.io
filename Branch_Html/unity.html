                                    This game was built over the course of one semester. I designed and created the main character and level art by myself.<br>
                                    I did NOT create the knight in the game nor most of the audio files. This was really my first "leap" into Unity which introduced me
                                    to what was possible. Check out my ArtStation back on the Home Page to see the design of this character!

                                    This one is called "Underground Rogue". Another solo project of mine that was meant to encapsulate everything I learned
                                    thus far and then some. This game challenged my work in 3D space and allowed me to become more comfortable with it.
